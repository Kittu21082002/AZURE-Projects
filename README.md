# End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project

This project is a comprehensive solution for aspiring and experienced data engineers to master **in-demand Azure tools and technologies**. It helped me land multiple job offers as a Data Engineer and stands out due to its practical, real-world approach. The project covers Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, Managed Identities, API Connections, and moreâ€”all from scratch.  

## Introduction

This project provides an **end-to-end solution** for implementing a data pipeline that fetches data from APIs, processes it using Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers), and serves it to stakeholders. It combines **real-world scenarios** with **interview preparation**, making it ideal for mastering Azure's ecosystem.


## Why This Project Stands Out

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All essential Azure tools such as **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Synapse Analytics** are covered in one video.  
2. **Real-World Scenarios**: The project goes beyond basics to address **real-world challenges** frequently asked in interviews.  
3. **Interview Questions**: Includes practical interview questions embedded in project implementation to prepare you effectively.

## Architecture Overview

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f84c47-d482-468d-9ed4-c5443aafe4c2)


The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:
- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data fetched from APIs.  
- **Silver Layer**: Processes and cleanses data using transformations in Azure Databricks.  
- **Gold Layer**: Serves clean, analytical data in Azure Synapse Analytics for stakeholders.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestration and data ingestion.  
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing and transformation with Spark.  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehousing and analytics.  
- **Power BI**: Visualization and reporting.  
- **APIs**: Fetching data directly from GitHub API.  
- **Medallion Architecture**: Ensures scalability and clarity in data flow.  

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Account**: [Create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).  
2. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python, Spark, and SQL.  
3. **Hardware**: A laptop or PC with a stable internet connection.  


## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Azure Services**:  
   - Create and configure Azure Data Factory, Databricks workspace, and Synapse Analytics.  
2. **Ingest Data**:  
   - Use Azure Data Factory to fetch data from GitHub APIs and store it in the Bronze Layer.  
3. **Process Data**:  
   - Transform the data in Azure Databricks using Spark, and load it into the Silver Layer.  
4. **Serve Data**:  
   - Load transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics (Gold Layer).  
5. **Visualize Data**:  
   - Connect Synapse Analytics to Power BI for reporting and visualization.  

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Pipelines**: Built dynamic pipelines with parameters and loops in Azure Data Factory.  
- **Real-Time Scenarios**: Addressed scenarios like API-based ingestion, dynamic transformations, and error handling.  
- **Medallion Architecture**: Implemented industry-standard practices for data structuring.  
- **Interview Preparation**: Included potential interview questions related to Azure tools and data engineering concepts.
## Lessons Learned

- Hands-on experience with in-demand Azure tools.  
- Understanding the importance of architecture in project planning.  
- Gained insights into interview expectations for data engineering roles.  
## Conclusion

This project is a one-stop solution for mastering Azure data engineering. By completing it, you will not only enhance your technical skills but also boost your confidence for interviews. It helped me crack multiple offers, and I hope it does the same for you!
